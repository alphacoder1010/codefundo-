We are making a Software which includes Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality
We are focusing on the How to save maximum life after occurrence Disaster.
1>Accessing the undiscovered Sites and providing help
We can get  Pre and post-disaster image from satellite and using crowd-sourced analysis and machine learning. We can identify  locations affected by the disaster that had not yet been assessed or received aid and help can be reached to them as soon as possible. 
AI spots geographical area of reported incident before human notice and  can alert key official

2>Social Media can help us to find missing people
Real time images and comments from Facebook, Twitterm ,Instagram can be analysed by AI and help the aid workers to reach to point as soon as possible.This data can also help rescue workers in reducing the time needed to find victims.
AI also help to view unstructured data and background posted to social channel and help to find missing people

3>Handling large number of calls
AI can interact with resident affected by calamity and instantly translate languages. 
During emergency situation , huge amount of call is time consuming. Ai can analyse the tone of urgency and, filter urgent call and give priority to them and hence help can be reached to needy ones as soon as possible.

4>Medication facilities to victims
Lots of life can be safe if medication is provided to them in time. Augmented reality can save lifes by providing real time information to Doctor  by wearing Smart glass and the Doctor can prescibe the best possible medication wothout actually moving to location
